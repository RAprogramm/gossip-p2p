//! Participant Management for Distributed Networks.
//!
//! This module and its submodules provide a comprehensive system for managing participants
//! within a distributed network application. It includes utilities for message handling,
//! participant storage, common utility functions, and participant models, facilitating
//! robust and flexible network participant management.
//!
//! ## Submodules
//!
//! - `message`: Defines the message formats used for communication between network participants.
//!   Includes serialization and deserialization functionalities for efficient network transmission.
//!
//! - `storage`: Implements storage mechanisms for tracking known participants within the network.
